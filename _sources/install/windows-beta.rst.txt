====================
|TexText| on Windows
====================

This guide explains how to install and use |TexText| together with |Inkscape| on a system
on which also |InkscapeOld| is installed.

.. warning::
    |Inkscape| builds for Windows are in fact nightly builds. Hence, operability of |TexText| might
    fail from one day to another. If you need a stable environment you are strongly encouraged
    to use :ref:`Inkscape 0.92<windows-install>`. Please report any issues.

.. important::

    1. Compared to previous versions of **TexText** for |InkscapeOld| |TexText| does
       not need any conversion utilities like ghostscript, pstoedit or pdfsvg.
       Furthermore, the required Python bindungs for the GTK-GUI are already included
       in the windows version of |Inkscape|.

    2. Currently, GTKSourceView is not available in the Windows version of |TexText|,
       hence syntax highlighting is not enabled. An installer will be provided soon.

The procedure depends on the Windows version you
are using

    - :ref:`ttwin10`

    - :ref:`ttwin78`

    power shell from the Windows Explorer ``right click`` while pressing the
    ``SHIFT`` key in the directory you want to open it. Then select ``Open power shell window here``.
    The power shell opens which usually has a **blue** background.

Preparation
-----------
In a power shell window execute the following steps:

1. Backup your existing Inkscape extension directory:

    .. code-block:: powershell

        cmd /r xcopy /S /E /Y %APPDATA%\inkscape\extensions %APPDATA%\inkscape\extensions.backup\

2. Remove the old TexText installation:

    .. code-block:: powershell

        cmd /r del /S /Q %APPDATA%\inkscape\extensions\textext
        cmd /r del /Q %APPDATA%\inkscape\extensions\textext.inx


Download and install the |Inkscape| package
-------------------------------------------

   in ``C:\InkscapeBeta\bin``.


Download and install |TexText|
------------------------------

1. Download the most recent **preview** package from :textext_current_release_page:`GitHub release page <release>`

   |Inkscape| executable from your terminal:

    .. code-block:: powershell

        ./setup_win.bat --inkscape-executable "C:\InkscapeBeta\bin\inkscape.exe"

    Setup will inform you if some of the prerequisites needed by |TexText| are missing.
